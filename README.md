# SportSense.AI
Intelligent Performance Analytics for NBA Athletes, and soon All Athletes

SportSense.AI is an innovative approach to predicting NBA players' game statistics, combining statistical analysis with modern NLP techniques. As sports enthusiasts we are harnessing our passion to develop a predictive model that integrates various data dimensions to forecast player performance.

SportSense.AI is a multi-faceted model that inputs the player, opponent team, and own team statistics using data from the entire season. It integrates a BERT-based model to analyze team news from sources like CBS. This model will process textual data to extract insights about player injuries, motivation, and other relevant factors. By combining these statistical and textual analysis, SportSense.AI provides a comprehensive prediction of a player's game statistics.

The insights gained could directly influence your strategies in fantasy NBA leagues. Our approach is designed to be robust, innovative, and deeply influenced by our love for the game.
